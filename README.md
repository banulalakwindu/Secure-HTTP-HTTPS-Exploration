# ðŸš€ Secure HTTP HTTPS Exploration

## :bulb: Introduction

ðŸŽ¯ **AIM:** Learn fundamental principles of computer and network security by studying attacks on computer systems, networks, and the Web. Understand how these attacks work and how to prevent and detect them.

ðŸŽ¯ **OBJECTIVES:**

- To understand Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.
- To understand the cryptographic usage in the secure protocol.
- To understand the fundamental principles of API.

## :gear: Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Express.js installed

```bash
npm install express
```

- OpenSSL installed
  **Windows**

  - Download OpenSSL: [Windows OpenSSL Download](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
  - Add OpenSSL to system variables: `C:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin` (Update the path based on your installation)
  - Run the following command before using OpenSSL:

```bash
set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.cfg
```

## :clipboard: Tasks

### :computer: HTTP Endpoint

#### :one: Step 01: Creating a HTTP Endpoint using Node

- [app.js](app.js)

#### :two: Step 02: Run Node Server

```bash
node app.js
```

#### :three: Step 03: Request from Server

Send a GET request to http://localhost:3000 (use your browser or Postman)

#### :four: Step 04: Capture Details

Capture Request and Response from Wireshark

### :lock: HTTPS Endpoint

#### :five: Step 05: SSL Key

Generate an SSL key size of 2048

```bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048
```

#### :six: Step 06: SSL Certificate

Create an SSL certificate using that key

```bash
openssl req -nodes -sha256 -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert
```

#### :seven: Step 07: Creating a HTTPS Endpoint using Node

- [appNew.js](appNew.js)

#### :eight: Step 08: Run Node Server

```bash
node appNew.js
```

#### :nine: Step 09: Request from Server

Send a GET request to https://localhost:3000 (use your browser or Postman)

#### :keycap_ten: Step 10: Capture Details

Capture Request and Response from Wireshark
